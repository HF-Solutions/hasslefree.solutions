### Posts

* Add, update or remove a post in the *Posts* collection.
* The **Staff Author** field links to members in the **Staff** collection.
* Documentation pages are organized in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.
* Change the defaults when new posts are created in `_posts/_defaults.md`.

### Contact Form

* Sends email to the address listed in company details.

### Staff

* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.
