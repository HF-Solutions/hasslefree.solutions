Thanks to a post I read by [Ricky White][0] on dev.to, I've decided to tackle the **[100 Days of Code][1]** challenge that I've seen all over this site. What started out as simple curiosity has now turn into a full-blown desire to take part, so thank you Ricky for being the straw that broke the camels back üòú

## What Will I Work On?

Thankfully, I've got a long list of things I've been wanting to add to [Tron][2], the Discord bot I began developing quite some time ago. More specifically, I've had a number of user requests for new commands for the bot, such as an adoption command, some new reaction images, and a potential notification system for [HaveIBeenPwned][3].

And while I honestly believe that I could work for 100 days straight on **Tron** and still have more stuff to add, I'm afraid that by the end of it I'll hate my beloved bot and no longer want to work on it üòÖ So with that, I've got a few other things in mind to work on:

1. Expanding my freelance company, **HassleFree Solutions**, and seeking out new clients.
    - Since it's not exactly coding, this won't be going towards my actual 1hr a day. However, it _can_ lead to more projects to work on.
    
2. Converting the existing **HassleFree Solutions** [website][4] from SquareSpace over to a self-hosted solution.
    - Specifically, I'll be using the [Gatsby.js][5] static site generator coupled with the [Dimension][6] starter plugin.
    - I don't intend to keep the blog on the website anymore, as all of my writing is posted to dev.to as well as kept in a personal archive.

3. Writing a Visual Studio Code extension to help me write my articles in Markdown.
    - This is actually something that came to mind while writing up this article. When adding links, I have to surround the link with brackets and recall what the last number I used for the URL was (3, 6, 9?)
    - It'd be nice to have a simple `Ctrl + Shift + I` shortcut that would surround the text with brackets and then add the next number in the sequence.
    - Any input on this would be appreciated as I won't get started on this for at least a couple weeks.

4. Expanding my PowerShell module, [Gamgee][7] to include some more functions that I've had stored in a Trello board for Zeus knows how long ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## My Rules

Just like those I've seen before me, my rules will be "slightly" different than the two initially given by the challenge. Granted, I'll still be adhering to those two rules, I'll be making a slight adjustment compared to what I've noticed most people do:

1. I've noticed that most people don't want to count client work towards this challenge, which is understandable for obvious reason. I however, _will_ be counting client work as I'm still getting my freelance gig off the ground and all the work I can do for my clients would be a great use of my time.

2. Since I'm still young and don't have any kids, there's not much that could be an acceptable reason to miss a day, but just in case, the only reasons I should miss a day are:
    - Extremely ill and can't get out of bed (rarely happens, but just in case, I'd like to have that base covered üòÖ)
    - Family Emergency

3. I'm going to throw in one last rule that writing for dev.to (as long as it's a technical article, and not a fluff piece) can also count towards the hour a day, as I usually spend a significant amount of time actually writing code, debugging, and researching stuff for my articles.

## And We're Off!

And with that, I'm officially off to get started üòä
