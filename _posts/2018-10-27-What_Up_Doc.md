Well, it's certainly been too long since my last blog post, so this is a catch-all for the things I've done since I last published and what my plans are now that the holiday season is approaching.

## Tron

Of course, I've been working on my baby, [Tron][0] by fixing bugs and adding a command that had been requested for some time.

- Bug Fixes:
  - [Fixed the `+adopt` command][5] to works as expected instead of not replying.
  - [Added Try/Catches][4] to help prevent **PermissionsDenied** errors that were crashing Tron.
  - [Fixed the `+reddit` command][3] so it properly displays an image from the requested subreddit.
  - [Fixed the `+birthday` command][1] so it properly saves birthdays.
    - For some reason I forgot to pass the client so it wasn't actually saving anything.
  - [Fixed the `+marriage` command][2] so it would accept input from the correct user.
  - [Fixed the `getImage()` function][7] so it would check the values properly.
  - [Fixed the `onCommandRun` event][8] so it wouldn't crash if the user tried running a command in DM's.
- Added:
  - [Added the Purge command][6] as requested by a few users.

## Enmeti

I managed to get [Enmeti][9] to a respectable state and it is now at version 1.1.1. You can insert links and/or images in place of existing text, on a blank line or in place of your cursor. I still have some more work to do, specifically with detecting the bottom of the file, but I believe it's in a much better place than when [I previously wrote about it][10].

For more information, check out the extension on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace][9], or visit the [repository on GitHub][11] ðŸ˜Š

## Personal/Company Website

For the longest time, [my company website][13] was hosted on [SquareSpace][12] until recently when I discovered the joy of [GitHub Pages][14]. After tinkering with it for a week or two, I managed to get comfortable enough that I created what is now [my new website][13] for **HassleFree Solutions, LLC**. When I completed the **HassleFree Solutions** site, I was confident that I could get [my own personal site][15] setup using a different theme and with blogging support. I'm using the [Material-Jekyll-Theme][16] created by [Alex Carpenter][16] for my personal site, while my company website uses the [Time Machine theme][17] with a bit of customization done by myself to make it look a bit nicer (imo).

## Conclusion

I need to write more! While I feel like I've done a lot of stuff since I last wrote, I don't feel quite as accomplished as I do when I also write about what I've been working on. So, with that said I intend to write something at least once a week and publish it whether or not I'm happy about it ðŸ˜…

That said, if you have any comments, criticisms, or suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know! There's a number of ways to contact me on my [personal site][18].
