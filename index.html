					<p>I found Devin on <a href="{{ contacts.upwork.url }}">Upwork</a> and he was a pleasure to work with. I had someone who left me in a pickle with my Squarespace website and Devin got the site looking exactly how I wanted it.  He not only worked within the Squarespace parameters, he did a bunch of customized stuff at a very low cost. Overall, I would recommend him to anybody building a website.</p>
