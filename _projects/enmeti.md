## Introduction

As mentioned, Enmeti is an extension for [Visual Studio Code][0] and all the code is open sourced under the MIT license. The codebase is hosted on GitHub and available here: [github.com/HF-Solutions/Enmeti][7]

## How to Use It

The simplest way to insert a link would be to select some text, right click, and then select `Insert Link`. It will show an **InputBox** so you can give it the URL of your link:

![Example-1][1]

As you can see in the gif, you can also use the default `Ctrl+Shift+I` keybinding, or even change it to whatever you prefer in [keybindings.json][5]:

![Keybindings.json][2]

As usual, any and all input is welcome and much appreciated ðŸ˜Š

## Changelog

### 1.2.0

- Added support for different languages
  - So far English, Spanish, and French are the only supported languages with English being the default.
  - You can set which language you'd like in your settings with the `enmeti.displayLanguage` property.
  - Changing the language does require a restart/reload of Visual Studio Code.
  - If you wish to fix any of the existing translations or add new ones, please open a PR or contact [Alcha][6]
- Fixed Enmeti from trying to insert a link when the **ESC** key is used on an **InputBox**.
